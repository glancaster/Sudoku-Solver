# Sudoku-Solver
Looking to create something similiar to other solvers such as [SudokuWiki.org](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm). Also, i'm using this project to dive deeper into the Rust Programming Language and improve my skills in that area. 

# Goals
- [x] Working Interactive Sudoku Board if user wants to solve the game themselves.
- [x] Utilize an API to pull boards of a given level or random.
- [ ] Implement Score, Time, Win/Loss for the Session or Board or user statistics. Use this with a Database.
- [ ] Implement Solvers
    - [ ] Naked Singles
- [ ] Implement settings section to change styles and themes

# Contributing
