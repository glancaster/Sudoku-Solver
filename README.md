# Sudoku-Solver
Looking to create something similiar to other solvers such as [SudokuWiki.org](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm). Also, i'm using this project to dive deeper into the Rust Programming Language and improve my skills in that area. 

# Goals
- [ ] Working Interactive Sudoku Board
- [ ] Utilize an API to pull boards of a given level or random.
- [ ] Implement Score, Time, Win/Loss for the Session or Board.
- [ ] Implement Solvers

# Contributing
